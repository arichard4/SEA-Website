<a href="http://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> does extraordinarily rigorous research on which charities and causes will do the best with your moneyâ€”the best we've seen. They make sure that their recommended charities do what they say they do, that what they say they do is effective, and that they have room to use your donation productively.

<a href="http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/">The Center for Effective Altruism</a> is a UK based umbrella organization. They run:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org">Giving What We Can</a> is a society of people who have pledged to donate 10% or more of their income to the most effective causes.</li>

<li><a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> researches how we can choose careers that will have the most impact. They also provide one-on-one career coaching for aspiring altruists.</li>

<a href="http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/">Effective Animal Activism</a> investigates the most effective ways of reducing non-human animal suffering. Since there are many more non-human animals than humans, and many live in extremely painful conditions on factory farms, animal suffering could be a very highly effective altruistic cause.</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">The Life You Can Save</a>, an offshoot of Peter Singer's book by the same name, is the largest effective altruist organization. Its 16,000 members have each pledged to donate at least 1% of their income to effective charities.

Because many, many more people will be alive at some point in the future than are alive today, interventions that affect the far future could have a far larger impact than those that take effect immediately. The <a href="http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk">Future of Humanity Institute</a> and the <a href="https://intelligence.org">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> use the tools of mathematics, philosophy, and science to research big-picture questions about the future of humankind, including the altruistic potential of working towards improving the lives of people in the far future.

<a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com/">Effective-Altruism.com</a> is an online forum for discussion of effective altruism.

Thanks to Harvard Effective Altruism for several of these descriptions.
