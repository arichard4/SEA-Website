SEA Website
===========

A few notes/issues: 
* Three categories of posts: blog posts, events, and people. People is kinda superfluous- I had good intentions of getting a Harvard-style full list of people with photos and descriptions up by launch, but it didn't happen. If we do end up doing this, we should also make people and organizers separate categories.
* The blog and events pages are kinda hacked together- in particular, they only display the most recent 5 for each. This OK for now, since we only have two each; I think it's OK indefinitely for events; for the blog, we'll see if we wind up actually writing posts. If we do, a known solution is here: http://www.marran.com/tech/category-pagination-in-jekyll/
* The entire site is currently ugly
